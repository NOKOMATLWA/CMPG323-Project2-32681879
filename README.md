# CMPG323-Project2-32681879
This is the second project of the semester where we will be focusing on the development of an API
## Project Description
- This is the second project of the semester where we will be creating a Web API that will interact with the Microsoft Entity Framework and Swagger for documentation.I will be implementing the CRUD(Create,Read.Update and Delete)  that will connect to a database storing
IoT device data for my project.Before kickstarting the project,i had to ensure that i have access to Visual Studio,.NET CORE 3.1 and the provided SQL database.

## Access 
- With the authorization in place,the user would have to register their credentials through the register model so that they can be able to run the endpoints.
JWT Authentication will create a token that will last for a minimum of 1 hour to allow access.
## Usage and Endpoints Explained 
-There are 5 endpoints that are implemented and the user will be able to interact with when running the API and that includes the Category.Device,Zone,Login.Register and they will have the following operations where :
- GET: Retrieves a resource
- POST: Creates a resource
- PUT: Updates or creates within an existing resource
- PATCH: Partially modifies an existing resource
- DELETE: Removes the resourc
This allows the user to be able to add,delete,read or update in the following tables(Category,Zone and Device).You are able to use the link generated and use it to further access the information.
