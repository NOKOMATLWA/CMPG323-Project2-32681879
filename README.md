## Access 
- With the authorization in place,the user would have to register their credentials through the register model so that they can be able to run the endpoints.
JWT Authentication will create a token that will last for a minimum of 1 hour to allow access.
## Usage and Endpoints Explained 
-There are 5 endpoints that are implemented and the user will be able to interact with when running the API and that includes the Category.Device,Zone,Login.Register and they will have the following operations where :
- GET: Retrieves a resource
- POST: Creates a resource
- PUT: Updates or creates within an existing resource
- PATCH: Partially modifies an existing resource
- DELETE: Removes the resource
